### About me   

- Currently I am an associate professor at [Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (IASM)](http://im.hit.edu.cn/en/) of Harbin Institute of Technology.<br />   

- Before joining IASM, I have been working as an assistant professor at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute.<br />  

- I was a post-doc at University of California, Berkeley under the supervision of Professor [Xin Guo](https://xinguo.ieor.berkeley.edu/). <br />  

- I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Université Paris Diderot under the supervision of Professor [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/).<br />
